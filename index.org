* About me

Software developer from Russia. I am passionate about software design and
functional programming in particular. I am lucky to work with Ruby because it's
my favorite programming language. Also I love Clojure (and lisps in general).
I am focused mostly on code quality and sofware design in general rather than
particular technologies.

Things I appreciate and/or respect in software development:
+ Functional programming
+ OOP
+ SOLID
+ KISS principle
+ TDD

* Work experience

** Full-stack Ruby on Rails Developer

[[https://insales.ru][InSales]] 2016-08-01 - present

- Participating in development of main product - SaaS-platform for
  creating online stores (like Shopify)
- Development of helpdesk system for InSales from scratch (mostly).
  This is a SPA react application talking to Rails 5 backend. The main goal of a
  project was (and is) gaining control over helpdesk system (which we couldnt
  get with Omnidesk and Zendesk we used before). With our own helpdesk can tweak
  whatever we (mostly, our support team) want: telegram notifications,
  statistics, integration with InSales. And there're many plans on future of the
  project making it more than helpdesk system.
  Tools I used:
  - Ruby on Rails 5 (API)
  - Postgresql
  - Pundit
  - EcmaScript 6
  - Webpack
  - React.js
  - Redux.js
  - Chart.js
  - Sass
  - Gitlab with CI
  - Docker (locally and in CI)
- Development of external application integrated with InSales that allows some
  of insales shops become resellers for another insales shops. Basically, it is
  supplier-reseller relationship app. It is not yet released but in active
  development and there're pool of interested customers that are trying it
  out. Tools:
  - Ruby on Rails 5
  - Postgresql
  - Pundit
  - Bootstrap for the moment
  - Gitlab with CI
  - Docker (locally, in CI and on production, though I am not responsible for
    production envorironment).
