* Bio

Originally from Russia. Started doing programming at 14, mostly competitive programming
(still remember some data structures and algorithms from that time :D).

Got my first job in the beginning of my first university year as PHP-developer.

Switched to Ruby accidentially (funny story, actually) and fell in love with the language
and object-oriented design. Got lucky enough to *not* start ruby career with rails.
Was working on inner CLI in pure ruby + thor (cli framework).

During the boom of popularity of functional programming I, naturally, got interested in it.
Good thing that smart people from all around the world adapted techniques form it to our
everyday object-oriented problems. Really enjoying looking at software design and development
from another perspective (which is why we should study paradigms, not languages).

As a developer I prefer learning ideas instead of technologies. I love SOLID principles
and how it's /kind of/ in a little war with the KISS principle. I appreciate TDD even though
I hate writing tests. I find it crazy fun and enjoyable to do interactive programming (hello lisps).
Of course, as a ruby developer I love OOP. And I am passionate about functional programming (but who isn't?).

* You should contact me if...

- The job benefits the humanity
- The project uses interesting technologies that can provide me with another perspective
  on software design.
- The company pays a lot ;)

Bear in mind I am russian citizen atm so I require a UK visa sponsorship.

** Some things that could interest me at the moment

- OCaml
- Haskell
- Staticly-typed languages in general (Golang sounds kinda interesting)
- Medical startups (everyone want to make a difference in this world, don't they?)
- Data analysis
- Data science (have no experience whatsoever but sounds cool).
- Remote work with ability to come to the office (visa sponsorship is a must, sadly).


* Work experience

** [[https://carwow.co.uk][carwow]]

/Software Engineer/ \\
/2019-02-04 - present/

- Worked as a part of Used/Leasing team for half a year as a fullstack dev.
  Did lots of feature AB-testing and consider the team and the company in general
  to have succeeded in that.
  Tools:
  - Ruby on Rails (latest version for the time)
  - Elm
  - LaunchDarkly (feature flags and ab-testing)
  - AppPhrase (for i18n)
- Moved to car-data team which is focused on developing core data APIs
  and uses Clojure for that.
  Moved during active migration of APIs to an external application so my Rails expertise
  was highly useful.

**  [[https://insales.ru][InSales]]

/Full-stack Ruby on Rails Developer/ \\
/2016-08-01 - 2019-01-19 (2 years 5 months)/


- Worked on authorization system of the main product - SaaS-platform for
  creating online shops (like Shopify)
- Developed the helpdesk system for InSales from scratch (mostly).
  It was a SPA react.js application with Rails 5 backend. The main goal of a
  project was (and is) gaining control over helpdesk system (which we couldn't
  get with Omnidesk and Zendesk we used before). With our own helpdesk we could tweak
  whatever we (mostly, our support team) wanted: telegram notifications,
  statistics, integration with InSales. And there're many plans on future of the
  project making it more than helpdesk system.
  Tools used:
  - Ruby on Rails 5 (API)
  - Postgresql
  - Pundit
  - EcmaScript 6
  - Webpack
  - React.js
  - Redux.js
  - Chart.js (for visualising stats).
  - Sass
  - Gitlab with CI
  - Docker (locally and in CI)
- Developed an external application integrated with InSales that allows some
  of insales shops become resellers for another insales shops. Basically, it is
  supplier-reseller relationship app. I left the company during beta-testing
  over a pool of interested customerst. Tools:
  - Ruby on Rails 5
  - Postgresql
  - Pundit
  - Bootstrap
  - Gitlab with CI
  - Docker (locally, in CI and on production, though I am not responsible for
    production envorironment).
