            <p>
              Originally from Russia. Started doing programming at 14, mostly competitive programming.
            </p>

            <p>
              Got my first job in the beginning of my first university year as PHP-developer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Switched to Ruby accidentially  and fell in love with the language and object-oriented design.
              Got lucky enough to <strong>not</strong> start ruby career with rails.
              Was working on inner CLI in pure ruby + thor (cli framework).
            </p>

            <p>
              During the boom of popularity of functional programming I, naturally, got interested in it.
              Good thing that smart people from all around the world adapted techniques form it to our
              everyday object-oriented problems. Really enjoying looking at software design and development
              from another perspective (which is why we should study paradigms, not languages).
            </p>

            <p>
              As a developer I prefer learning ideas instead of technologies. I love SOLID principles
              and how it's <i>kind of</i> in a little war with the KISS principle. I appreciate TDD even though
              I hate writing tests. I find it crazy, fun and enjoyable to do interactive programming (hello lisps).
              Of course, as a ruby developer I love OOP. And I am passionate about functional programming (but who isn't?).

                  Joined Used/leasing team during the time of rapid growth.
                  Done lots of A/B testing and worked closely with design and data analysis teams.
                  Also learned Elm along with lots of other tech.

                <p>
                  After that was transferred to car-data team working on core data APIs written in Clojure.
                  I joined during introduction of significant changes to data structures and storages so I've done a lot of refactoring of Ruby code.
                </p>

                <p>
                  After refactoring most of the work was data transformation (cadata about cars is provided by external companies) and app improvements.

            <div class="subtitle is-size-6">2016-08-01 - 2019-01-19 (2 years 5 months)</div>

                <p>InSales is a platform for creating online shops. Essentially, russian Shopify.</p>

                <p>After joining the company I was working on authorization system of the main platform to simplify it.</p>

                <p>
                  After that I was given new inner project - helpdesk system to replace Zendesk.
                  The main point behind developing our own system was the ability to fully tailor it for our needs:
                  statistics, reinforcement system for our support team, integration with InSales itself, telegram notifications.
                  That was only MVP. In fact, execs had big plans stored for that system
                </p>

                <p>
                  Other person was working on it before me and it already had some nice design done.
                  Unfortunately, the code was unusable so I had to completely rewrite the backend and refactor a lot of frontend.
                  Looking back, I regret refactoring it. I should've rewritten it while it was a small prototype. Instead, I spent
                  a lot of time fighting with components throughout the whole development.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When helpdesk system was ready and being used by our support team I was given another inner project - an application
                  that would allow different businesses hosted on InSales have supplier-reseller relationship. I managed to develop it
                  up to closed beta testing before leaving the company in favour of moving to the UK.

                <p>Lakehouse is (was?) a Ruby on Rails shop working for various companies including L'Oreal</p>
                <p>
                  I joined to work mostly on legacy logistics app for L'Oreal up until
                  they decided to rewrite it from scratch with a different company.

                <p>
                  After that I was helping with other rails projects but mostly was working on Lakehouse's own product.
                  It's called [ODIN](http://www.o-din.ru/) and is a solution for companies managing big buildings like business centres.

                <p>
                  My main contribution there was fixing the project structure. Before that it was 3 conflicting git branches for each customer.
                  I introduced rails engines in order to share code between projects (every customer had a unique set of features so the apps were different).

                  I wanted to work with an actual object-oriented language so I came seeking for a Java job.
                  My interviewers liked me and offered me a Ruby dev position instead. I accepted.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This is where my Ruby journey began. I had to learn it really fast and
                  mostly by myself (some Perl experience from high school helped).
                  My boss used to say he saved my soul by bringing me into Ruby world instead of Java's :)
                </p>

                  I was working on internal tool processing data from Redmine APIs (helpdesk system).
                  It also was a CLI for interacting with Redmine through console (I even continued using it on my next job).
                </p>

                <p>
                  After that I was working on internal GIS-project. But, unfortunately, we didn't have time to finish it due
                  to the company going bankrupt.
